# SalesRecord_GoogleBigQuery


## Description

This is a practice sales dataset of accessories having about 5 million records of data.

### Dependencies

* I have used Google Big Query for the execution of queries by signing up for FREE TIER GCP (Google Cloud Platform).

## Getting Started


### Executing program

* The following query joins all the tables i.e. **region_table**, **items_table**, **order_table**, **total_table** and **items_table** (a total of 5 tables)

<hr>


* The following query shows the country **"Rwanda"** has higher total_revenue and the data is sorted in descending order by **total_revenue** with an alias **TotalRevenue**

* The following query shows **sales channel preference** between **"online"** and **"offline"**. It shows that although there is no much difference between the total profit, but **offline** channel seems to be a little higher.
